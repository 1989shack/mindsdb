Hey guys,
I have an issue with the falsk restplus + swagger ui setup

I want to use a proxy for authentcation but swagger ui generates links in the html pointing to server resources on the original host, rather than the proxy.

So, the proxy works something like:

`ip:proxy_port/mindsdb_server` -> `localhost:mindsdb_server_port`

But then swagger ui's generate HTML (this is on the client computer, so the client doesn't have access to mindsdb_server directly, only to the auth proxy) will ask for:

`localhost:mindsdb_server_port/swagger.json` (or some other static resource)

instead of asking for:

`ip:proxy_port/mindsdb_server/swagger.json`

I've attempted to fix this using werkzeug:

```
from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app, x_for=1, x_host=1)
```

Which *seems* to fix the urls for most of the static swagger resources (e.g. the css and the fonts) but not for `swagger.json`

Did you guys run into this before and know an easy fix
